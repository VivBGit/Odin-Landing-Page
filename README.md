# Odin-Landing-Page

The focus of this exercise is to play around with and understand how the content is displayed and manipulated within the parameters of the screen and project limitations. 

A simple yet effective layout will be used to create an often seen format for landing pages.

In order to concentrate attention on the layout and placement of information, I will for the majority, be following the suggestions supplied by TOP so as not to draw the focus away by uneccessary text or detail. To supplement this though and highlight any development within my own skillset, I will add a theme of Rainbow Colours.

Completion note: I have finalised this project although there are further developments I would make. These include: 
- adjusting the logo size to be more manoeuvreable within the page
- removing the background/box of each paint blob so it is just the paint colour
- changing the paint blobs to be buttons so clicking on them leads somewhere
- filing the page with more colour in line with the theme
- allowing the 'return to top' button to scroll with the page not be stuck at the bottom
- instead of having a placeholder for a pot of gold, make the button a pot of gold and put in its place.
- the 'Play Song' button would play the song, not take you to youtube to play it
