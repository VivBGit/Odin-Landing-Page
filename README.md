# Odin-Landing-Page

The focus of this exercise is to play around with and understand how the content is displayed and manipulated within the parameters of the screen and project limitations. 

A simple yet effective layout will be used to create an often seen format for landing pages.

In order to concentrate attention on the layout and placement of information, I will for the majority be using the quotes and images supplied by TOP so as not to draw the focus away by uneccessary text or detail. To supplement this though and highlight any development within my own skillset, I will add a theme of Rainbow Colours.
